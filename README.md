# SQL-for-Data-Engineering

This repository contains a structured collection of essential SQL commands and practice queries focused on real-world data engineering scenarios. Each folder covers a core SQL concept, providing hands-on examples to strengthen your query-building skills and understanding of relational databases.

## 📚 Topics Covered

The project is organized into topic-specific directories, including:

- **ALTER Queries** – Modifying existing table structures
- **Aggregation Functions** – SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc., with practical sub-queries and CTE examples
- **Analytical and Window Functions** – Advanced SQL for ranking, running totals, and partitions
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** – Simplifying complex sub-queries for better readability
- **SQL Clauses & JOINS** – Mastering WHERE, GROUP BY, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and more
- **Database Constraints (PostgreSQL)** – Enforcing data integrity using PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL
- **DDL Commands** – CREATE, ALTER, DROP for managing schema objects
- **Data Exploration with SELECT** – Retrieving and filtering data effectively
- **Primary & Foreign Keys** – Understanding relational links between tables
- **Sub-queries** – Writing nested queries for advanced use cases
- **Views** – Creating virtual tables for reusable queries
- **Window Functions** – Performing calculations across result sets

## 🗂️ Project Structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maimran786/SQL-for-data-engineering.git
   cd SQL-for-data-engineering
2. **Open SQL Files:**
  - Use any SQL editor or IDE (such as DBeaver, pgAdmin, or VSCode with SQL extensions).

3. **Set Up a Database:**
- Recommended engine: PostgreSQL
- Load sample datasets or create your own to run and test the queries.
## 🧰 Requirements
- SQL environment (PostgreSQL recommended)

- Optional: Sample database (e.g., Northwind, AdventureWorks, or your own schema)
